# About ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# chkgausslogs.sh
# 
# Checks the output file of a gaussian job.
# Will test for the normal termination of the job, whether a stationary
# point was found, if any imaginary frequencies exist, and if enthalpy
# and free energy information can be found.  
# 
# Invocation ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# chkgausslogs.sh {list of gaussian logs to check}
# Many log files can be checked at once. The "*.log" argument will also 
# work. Bash expansion works as expected.
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# the log files are given as arguments to the script
