#!/usr/bin/env python3

# This script requires at least Python 3.2.

## ABOUT ######################################################################
# This script analyzes a PDB file, find the distances between two atoms of
# interest between a certain cutoff, measured in Angstroms.  This variable is
# specified below (as a floating point number).

cutoff = 20.0

# You must identify the solute and solvent atoms of interest.
# These are the three letter codes which appear in the third field of an ATOM
# line.

solute_atom = 'S00'
solvent_atom = 'N04'

# THESE THREE VARIABLES ARE ALL THAT THE USER HAS TO CHANGE.
#
### Invocation ################################################################
#
# PDB files must be given as arguments.  Wildcard expansion is appropriately
# handled by the shell. Though the files need not have the .pdb suffix,
# this script depends upon the PDB format specifically.  It will not operate
# on other formats without adjusting some of the string splitting routines.
